# Eurorack-Oscillator_Bank
A 6-oscillators Eurorack module (10HP) based on the CD40106BE Hex Schmitt-Trigger Inverters chip

NOTES: A Hard-sync input is available for each oscillator. The values of caps C1 to C6 determine the frequency
of the corresponding oscillator, and can be changed. See this [link]([url](https://www.talkingelectronics.com/pay/BEC-2/Page49.html)
for a frequency calculator and some interesting stuff about the Schmitt Triggers
